# 🧠 AI Medicine Intelligence System

## Overview
The **AI Medicine Intelligence System** is a smart AI-based ecosystem designed to manage, analyze, and recommend medicines using advanced search, vector similarity, and large language models (LLMs).  
It is divided into three main modules:

---

## ⚙️ 1. AI Filter Medicine Module
### Purpose:
This module enables **intelligent medicine searching** using vector similarity and natural language understanding.

### Key Features:
- Uses **FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search)** for fast similarity matching.
- Employs **SentenceTransformer embeddings** to convert text into numeric vectors.
- Supports **multilingual queries** (English, Hindi, Hinglish).
- Can filter medicines by **form**, **category**, or **disease**.

### Core Flow:
1. Load medicine data from CSV/Parquet file.  
2. Generate text embeddings for all medicines.  
3. Store embeddings in FAISS index.  
4. Accept user query → Convert query to embedding.  
5. Retrieve top similar medicines based on cosine similarity.

### Example:
> User Query: “Fever aur headache ke liye medicine”  
> Output: Paracetamol, Disprin, Calpol Suspension, etc.

## ⚙️ 2. AI Filtering Systems Module
### Purpose:
This module handles **data management**, **user uploads**, and **background processing** for medicine datasets.

### Key Features:
- Flask + Celery-based **backend system**.  
- MongoDB integration for storing medicine and user data.  
- Allows CSV uploads and automatic validation.  
- Uses Google Gemini API for **data enrichment** (e.g., generating descriptions or instructions).

### Core Flow:
1. User uploads medicine data file.  
2. Background task processes data and updates MongoDB.  
3. Gemini API enriches data with AI-generated insights.  
4. Admin can view and manage all medicines from dashboard.

## ⚙️ 3. Symptoms → Medicine AI Model
### Purpose:
This module uses AI reasoning to **recommend medicines based on symptoms** using both similarity search and Gemini reasoning.

### Key Features:
- Takes symptom or natural language input from user.  
- Uses **FAISS search** to find related medicines.  
- Sends filtered medicines to **Gemini model** for reasoning and summarization.  
- Returns final recommendations in structured JSON format.

### Core Flow:
1. Input: “Patient has cold, cough, and mild fever.”  
2. AI Filter → Retrieves top similar medicines.  
3. Gemini → Filters and ranks best matches.  
4. Output: Medicine list with scores and instructions.

## 🧩 Integration (Future Scope)
In the unified system:
- **AI Filter** will serve as the **API layer**.  
- **AI Systems** will manage **data ingestion and enrichment**.  
- **Symptoms → Medicine AI** will provide **intelligent recommendations** using Gemini.  

All modules will share a **single MongoDB collection (`medicines`)** for smooth data flow.
